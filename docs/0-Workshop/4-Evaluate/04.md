# 4.4 Run Evaluation Script

To run the evaluation script from the Visual Studio Code terminal:
 - You need to be authenticated on Azure
 - You need to have the `azure-ai-evaluation` package installed

You should have done the first step at the start of this workshop, and the dev container already has the package installed for the second. 


## 1. Run the Script 

Run the evaluation script using the following command

    ```bash title=""
    python evaluate.py
    ```

## 2. Observe the Output

- Note that there are **13 response records** corresponding to the 13 test inputs in our evaluation dataset. _These reflect the first stage of evaluation flow where the target AI (chat app) is creating a responses file based on the test inputs given._
- Note that you can _view the traces in local device_ at the URL provided. This will launch a local version of the trace viewer.

```bash title=""
Starting prompt flow service...
Start prompt flow service on 127.0.0.1:23333, version: 1.16.2.
You can stop the prompt flow service with the following command:'pf service stop'.

You can view the traces in local from http://127.0.0.1:23333/v1.0/ui/traces/?#run=main_evaluate_chat_with_products_rxna_3r9_20241216_163719_733780

## 3. Rate Limit Errors

Occasionally you might see an error message that looks like this. This relates to the tokens per minute rate limits on your evaluation model deployment. _The script is designed to handle them and continue running - reconfiguring the model can help_.

```bash title=""
[2024-12-16 16:44:07 +0000][promptflow.core._prompty_utils][ERROR] - Exception occurs: RateLimitError: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'code': '429', 'message': 'Requests to the ChatCompletions_Create Operation under Azure OpenAI API version 2024-06-01 have exceeded token rate limit of your current AIServices S0 pricing tier. Please retry after 60 seconds. Please contact Azure support service if you would like to further increase the default rate limit.'}}
[2024-12-16 16:44:07 +0000][promptflow.core._prompty_utils][WARNING] - RateLimitError #2, Retry-After=60, Back off 60.0 seconds for retry.
```


## 4. Final Result

Once the evaluation workflow completes, you should see a run summary that looks like this. Note that the evaluation results are saved locally, and also published to the Azure AI Foundry portal.

```bash title=""

## 5. Interpreting Results

The console output may be truncated, but the results are also stored in a local JSON. Check out the `src.sample/api/myevalresults.json` for a sample file showing the outputs from a previous run. The snippet below reproduces one of the rows from those results for our observation:

1. The `inputs.query` and `inputs.truth` are from the test input file
1. The `outputs.context` reflects retrieved product documents used (RAG)
1. The `outputs.response` gives the target models returned response
1. The `outputs.groundedness.groundedness` has a rating of **1** (not grounded)
1. The `outputs.groundedness.groundedness_reaason` explains why (context unused)

_Note_: While the response is not grounded in the context, it does in fact reflect our prompt template guidance to ask for clarifications on questions where the intent is not clear.
