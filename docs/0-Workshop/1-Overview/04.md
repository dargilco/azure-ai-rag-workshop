# 1.5 Contoso Chat Sample

Once you've familiarized yourself with the basic setup, ideation and evaluation capabilities, you can explore the [Contoso Chat](https://aka.ms/aitour/contoso-chat) sample for more advanced insights, on your own. 

This sample uses the same retail dataset used in this RAG Chat workshop, but streamlines the end-to-end development workflow with core developer tools like Azure Developer CLI, to automate provisioning and deployment. The sample also teaches you how to package up your application prototype and deploy it into production using Azure Container Apps.
