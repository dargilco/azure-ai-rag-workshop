# 2.1 [Create AI Project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/tutorials/copilot-sdk-create-resources?tabs=macos#create-a-project)


!!! warning "Instructions"

    To create a project in Azure AI Foundry, follow these steps:

    1. Go to the Home page of Azure AI Foundry.
    1. Select + Create project.
    1. Enter a name for the project. Keep all the other settings as default.
    1. Projects are created in hubs. If you see Create a new hub select it and specify a name. 1. Then select Next. (If you don't see Create new hub, don't worry; it's because a new one is being created for you.)
    1. Select Customize to specify properties of the hub.
    1. Use any values you want, except for Region. We recommend you use either East US2 or Sweden Central for the region for this tutorial series.
    1. Select Next.
    1. Select Create project.

1. Change the default project name to something meaningful - e.g., I used `ninarasi-ragchat-v1`.
