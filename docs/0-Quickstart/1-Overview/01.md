## 2️⃣ | Build Prototype 

In this section you learn to enhance the default prototype application with a retrieval augmented generation pattern that grounds the chat AI responses in your data.

=== "What You Need"

    You should have completed Part 1 of the tutorial and have:

    1. An Azure AI project created with models deployed
    1. An Azure AI search index created in that project
    1. The Azure CLI and relevant Python packages installed
    1. Your local environment variables configured for coding

=== "What You Do"

    1. Get example data
    1. Create a search index of the data for the chat app to use
    1. Develop custom RAG code


=== "Relevant Resources"

    1. [Concept: Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/concepts/retrieval-augmented-generation)
